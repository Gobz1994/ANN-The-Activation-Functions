# ANN-The-Activation-Functions
A clear description for four different activation functions used in Artificial Neural Networks
This documentation was made possible to clear and explain the four commonly used different activation functions in Artifical Neural Networks (ANN). 
- The Threshold Function
- The Sigmoid Function
- The Rectifier Function
- Hyperbolic Tangent Function

Of course there are other functions however this documentation only covers those mentioned above.
I will be sharing how to implement each function using Python.

Feel free to copy and share the code mentioned throughout this documentation. Also, I would highly appreciate your honest comments about this. 
Thank you again
