# ANN-The-Activation-Functions
A clear description for four different activation functions used in Artificial Neural Networks
This documentation was made possible to clear and explain the four different activation functions in Artifical Neural Networks (ANN). Feel free to copy and share the code mentioned throughout this documentation. Also, I would highly appreciate your honest comments about this. 
Thank you again
